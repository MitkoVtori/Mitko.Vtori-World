#           Welcome to the Moving Target game!                                                                                             #
#                                                                                                                                          #
#           The rules are simple:                                                                                                          #
#           You'll receive a random list of targets,                                                                                       #
#           every target has it's own number(integer).                                                                                     #
#                                                                                                                                          #
#           There are three options:                                                                                                       #
#           Shoot {Target} {Power}: Shooting the target's number with the chosen power.                                                    #
#           Example: Shoot 1 200                                                                                                           #
#           If 200 is smaller or equal to the first's target number, your target will be reduced by the power.                             #
#           If 200 is bigger than your target with 5 or more, the power is too much and you'll miss the shot.                              #
#           If the target's value it's between -5 and 0, the target will be removed.                                                       #
#           Sometimes, while you're playing there's a chance for the game to add a target.                                                 #
#           Second option, Strike {Target} {Radius}: You'll directly remove the target, and all the targets in the chosen radius.          #
#           Example: Strike 4 2                                                                                                            #
#           Removes the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th target, because 4th target is your chosen target, and 2 is your chosen radius.          #
#                                                                                                                                          #
#                               BE CAREFUL! At some point the game will decide to say End and the game ends!                               # 
#                                      The game is considered won if there aren't any targets                                              #
#                            At the end of the game will be printed a list of the left targets value                                       #
#                                           You can also End the game by typing End                                                        #
#                                                                                                                                          #
